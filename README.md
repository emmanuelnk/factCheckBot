# Fact Check Bot

[![Actions Status](https://github.com/twilio-labs/sample-template-nodejs/workflows/Node%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/twilio-labs/sample-appointment-reminders/actions)

## About

A bot to detect whether input information is true and accurate

### How it works

This application is only a barebones Node.js application using Express.js. Whenever, possible we should be using this. However, if you are using a framework like React.js, Angular or similar that comes with their own standardized application structure, you should try to merge these by using the same `README` structure and test coverage, configuration etc. as this project.

### Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- A Twilio account - [sign up](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio)

### Twilio Account Settings

This application should give you a ready-made starting point for writing your
own appointment reminder application. Before we begin, we need to collect
all the config values we need to run the application:

| Config&nbsp;Value | Description                                                                                                                                                  |
| :---------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Account&nbsp;Sid  | Your primary Twilio account identifier - find this [in the Console](https://www.twilio.com/console).                                                         |
| Auth&nbsp;Token   | Used to authenticate - [just like the above, you'll find this here](https://www.twilio.com/console).                                                         |
| Phone&nbsp;number | A Twilio phone number in [E.164 format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.164) - you can [get one here](https://www.twilio.com/console/phone-numbers/incoming) |

### Local development

After the above requirements have been met:

1. Clone this repository and `cd` into it

```bash
git clone git@github.com:emmanuelnk/factCheckBot.git
cd factCheckBot
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

3. Set your environment variables

```bash
npm run setup
```

4. Run the application

```bash
npm start
```

Alternatively, you can use this command to start the server in development mode. It will reload whenever you change any files.

```bash
npm run dev
```

5. Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

That's it!

### Tests

You can run the tests locally by typing:
